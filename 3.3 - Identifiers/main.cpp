     *Names can contain letters, digits and underscores
     *Names must begin with a letter or an underscore (_)
     *Names are case sensitive (myVar and myvar are different variables)
     *Names cannot contain whitespaces or special characters like !, #, %, etc.
     *Reserved words (like C++ keywords, such as int) cannot be used as names
